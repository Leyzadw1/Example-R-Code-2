The code in this repo is just for fun. I was investigating whether it would be possible to encrypt data using Principal Component Analysis.
As such, there is a hidden message encrypted within Data_Set_1 of this repo. Try and see if you can decode it.
If not use the R code called 'PCA_Encryption' to find the message. Let's just say I'm a Beatles fan :)
